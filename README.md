# RNN-Based Prediction Model

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to predict values using the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model based on original data that I generated. I created the original values using a sine function and introduced noise by randomizing the data to simulate real-world variability. Using the RNN model, I predicted values based on this noisy data, and the predicted values closely matched the original values, resulting in a low error percentage.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **RNN**

## Key Contributions
- Generated original data using a sine function and introduced noise to create a more realistic dataset.
- Implemented the RNN model to predict values from the noisy data.
- Achieved a high accuracy rate with a minimal error percentage, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

## Results
Successfully developed a predictive model with low error margins, validating the strength of the RNN approach in time-series forecasting.
