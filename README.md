# RNN - Project
Analyzed and implemented an RNN model in Python, achieving a grade of 90 and predicting 
values with a 95% accuracy rate closely matching the original data

The goal of the project is to predict values according to the RNN-Recurrent Neural network model through the original data that I created.
My role in the project was to generate the original values through a sine function and I also randomized this data to make some noise to the data I used the RNN model to get predicted values according to the values I generated and in the end I got predicted values at the same rate as the original values and therefore the percentage of error is small.
I used Python language in building this project.
Example: RNN model works according to input and output
For example diabetes if the patient has 2 out of 3 "high glucose percentage or weight loss or poor eyesight" (this is the input) then he is considered to have diabetes (this is the output).

המטרה של הפרוייקט לחזות ערכים לפי מודל RNN-Recurrent Neural network דרך נתונים מקוריים שייצרתי.
התפקיד שלי בפרוייקט הייה ייצור הערכים המקוריים  דרך פונקציית סינוס וגם עשיתי ראנדומייז לנתונים האלו בכדי  לעשות קצת רעש לנתונים והשתמשתי במודל RNN בכדי לקבל ערכים חזויים לפי הערכים שייצרתי ובסוף קיבלתי ערכים חזויים באותו קצב עם הערכים המקוריים ולפי כך אחוז השגיאה קטן.
השתמשתי בשפת פייתון בבניית הפרויקט הזה.
דוגמה :מודל RNN עובד לפי קלט ופלט 
לדוגמה מחלת הסוכרת אם החולה יש לו 2 מתוך 3 "אחוז גלוקוז גבוהה או ירידת משקל או לקות ראייה ירודה" (זה הקלט) אז הוא נחשב כחולה סוכרת (זה הפלט).
