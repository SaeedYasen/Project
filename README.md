# Simple RNN - Sine Function Prediction  

This project demonstrates how a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) can learn to predict future values of the sine function based on previously observed data. The goal is to train the RNN to recognize temporal patterns without explicitly using the sine function formula.  

## Features  
- Generates training data using the sine function.  
- RNN is used to learn sequential dependencies in the data.  
- Predicts future values based solely on previous observations.  
- Demonstrates fundamental sequence modelling concepts.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- NumPy & Matplotlib  

## How to Run  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
